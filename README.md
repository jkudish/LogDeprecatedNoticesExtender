# Log Deprecated Notices Extender

This developer-oriented WordPress plugin extends Andrew Nacin's Log Deprecated Notices to show a link in the WP 3.3+ Toolbar.

I sync changes between github and the [WordPress.org plugin repository](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/log-deprecated-notices-extender/) whenever there is a release. Why? Because collaboration is made much easier on github :)


# Installation

1. Make sure you already have the [Log Deprecated Notices](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/log-deprecated-notices/) plugin by [Andrew Nacin](http://nacin.com)
2. Install through the WordPress admin or upload the plugin folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Enjoy!
